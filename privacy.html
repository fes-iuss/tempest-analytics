      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Stormpire Discord Application (the “App”) handles information when you use it in Discord servers or direct messages.

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Process</h2>
      <p>To operate the App, we may process the following categories of data from Discord:</p>

        <li>Identifiers: user IDs, usernames, server IDs, channel IDs, and role IDs</li>
        <li>Configuration and preferences: server‑level settings, feature flags</li>
        <li>Interaction metadata: commands used, timestamps, and basic usage logs</li>
        <li>Message metadata: limited details necessary to perform requested actions</li>
        <li>Message content: only when strictly required for a specific feature or command</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not intentionally process special categories of personal data. Do not submit sensitive information to or through the App.</p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
